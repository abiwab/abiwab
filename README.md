# Hi, I’m William ! 👋

**Graphic Designer & Web Dev | Culinary Engineer | Cat Servant**

Based in **Rennes, France**, I’ve spent the last **15 years** bridging the gap between aesthetics and logic. I’m a firm believer in the Cartesian approach: I love science, clean systems, and professional-grade tools—whether that’s a well-configured IDE or a high-carbon chef’s knife.

I don't buy much, but when I do, I look for quality and durability. I apply that same philosophy to my work: I try to build things that are meant to last.

### 🚀 What’s Cooking? (Literally)
I’m currently merging two of my greatest passions—**Coding and Gastronomy**—into a single project. 

* **The Project:** I’m developing a **custom Markup Language for recipes**. 
* **The Vision:** I believe recipes should be as structured and version-controlled as code. No more messy blogs; just clean, parsed, and developer-friendly culinary data.

### 🛠 My Professional Gear
* **Design & Dev:** 15 years of freelance experience creating visual identities at day and web experiences at night.
* **Pastry & Cuisine:** When I'm not coding, I’m probably obsessing over the perfect hydration for a dough or testing semi-pro kitchen equipment.
* **The Manager:** I share my home office with a very cute **black cat** who acts as my lead code reviewer (mostly by sitting right between me and my keyboard).

### 👋 Let's Connect!

I’m looking for fellow developers and foodies to discuss the evolution of Gram or just to chat about design, code, and science. Whether you want to contribute, give feedback, or share a professional pastry tip:

Feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or just reach out! 🍰💻
